My Client Wants

Hey,

I hope you're doing well.
Just heard from the client.
They're willing to pay us $50/hr to build a site with the following requirements.

A jumbotron header with a tasteful red background.
A 2 column layout with some of their product features.
A full-width navbar at the top of the screen which is responsive.
Lots of buttons
One huge 'buy now' button at the bottom. It should do something fancy when they hover over it.
A footer with lots of buttons and images.
Is that cool?
Let me know ASAP.
Thanks!
