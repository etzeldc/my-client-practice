My Client Wants

Hey,

I hope you're doing well.
Just heard from the client.
They're willing to pay us $25/hr to build a site with the following requirements.

A jumbotron header with a tasteful blue-green background.
A full-width navbar which sticks to the top of the page when you scroll.
Lots of ways to click "buy now"
A footer with a beautiful image, mostly using green.
Is that cool?
Let me know ASAP.
Thanks!
